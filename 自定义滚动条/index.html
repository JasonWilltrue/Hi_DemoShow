            Although many people talk about the super performance of quantum computing, such as one second to complete the current supercomputer
            computing tasks for several years, but so far did not create a true sense of the quantum computer, one of the
            very important reason is that, The state of particles used in quantum computation is not stable, and any electromagnetic
            or physical interference can easily disrupt its work. The state of the Mayola fermion is very stable, which makes
            it a perfect choice for making quantum computers. Six months ago in the laboratory of Shanghai Jiaotong University,
            Jia Jinfeng successfully captured it. Speaking of the scene, Jia Jinfeng said: "In fact, I started to hear the
            Mayolana fermions, I think this thing may not be done 20 years out. Using a special material preparation method,
            Jia Jinfeng's research team has grown topological insulators on the superconductors with thickness of 5 nanometers.
            The topological superconductor materials are prepared and finally the Mayolana fermions are found at the interface
            of the topological superconductors. The mysterious particles were captured 80 years, but also let Jia Jinfeng
            more firm with its confidence in the manufacture of quantum computers. Speaking of the future of the plan, Jia
            Jinfeng said: "I hope to within a few years to do the topological quantum bit!" (Before) the world has not, so
            if we cut into this from the point, we are the same with the world The starting line, for our country, this is
            able to catch up with the footsteps of quantum computing, a starting point.
